{/* TL;DR */}
Choose Playwright for cross-browser support and advanced features, or Puppeteer for Chrome-focused lightweight automation.

## The Importance of Headless Browser Automation

Headless browsers are powerful tools that enable web page manipulation without a GUI. They're essential for web scraping, automated testing, PDF rendering, and various automation tasks.

Before selecting specific tools, understand the [fundamentals of web scraping](/python--selenium-web-scraping-tutorial) and automation requirements.

// const browser = await webkit.launch();
```

### Performance Comparison

| Feature | Puppeteer | Playwright |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Launch Speed | Fast | Moderate |
| Memory Usage | Low | Moderate |
| Parallel Processing | Good | Excellent |
| Network Control | Basic | Advanced |

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Scraping

**Puppeteer Implementation**
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function scrapePuppeteer() {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    
    const title = await page.evaluate(() => {
        return document.title;
    });
    
    console.log('Title:', title);
    
    await browser.close();
}

scrapePuppeteer();
```

**Playwright Implementation**
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function scrapePlaywright() {
    const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    
    const title = await page.title();
    console.log('Title:', title);
    
    await browser.close();
}

scrapePlaywright();
```

## Selection Guidelines

### Choose Puppeteer When:
- Chrome-focused development
- Lightweight and fast processing needed
- Simple tasks are primary focus
- Extensive community support is important

### Choose Playwright When:
- Cross-browser testing required
- Complex automation tasks
- Multi-language support important
- Latest features are priorities

## Advanced Feature Comparison

### Network Control

**Playwright**
```javascript
// Advanced network control
await page.route('**/*.jpg', route => route.abort());
await page.route('**/api/data', route => {
    route.fulfill({
        status: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ mock: 'data' })
    });
});
```

### Parallel Processing

**Playwright**
```javascript
// Efficient parallel processing
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();

const pages = await Promise.all([
    context.newPage(),
    context.newPage(),
    context.newPage()
]);

await Promise.all(pages.map(page => 
    page.goto(`https://example.com/page${pages.indexOf(page)}`)
));
```
