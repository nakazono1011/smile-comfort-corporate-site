{/* TL;DR */}
Mobile proxies provide internet access through actual smartphone devices, offering superior detection avoidance for mobile-specific sites and geo-restriction bypass. While more expensive ($3-15/GB) than residential proxies, they're essential for app testing and mobile ad verification with significantly lower detection rates.

## What Are Mobile Proxies?

Mobile proxies are internet access systems that route traffic through real smartphones and tablets using 4G/5G cellular networks. Unlike other proxy types covered in our [Ultimate Guide to Proxy Services & Web Scraping](/en/media/proxy-guide), mobile proxies use mobile carrier IP addresses, making them extremely difficult to detect.

![Mobile Proxy Architecture Overview](/images/mobile-proxies-explained/cover.webp)

## Technical Architecture of Mobile Proxies

### Core Operating Principles

1. **Physical Device Farms**: Large facilities housing thousands of actual smartphones
2. **Carrier Networks**: Each device connects independently via SIM cards to mobile networks
3. **Proxy Servers**: Intermediary systems routing traffic between devices and users
4. **IP Rotation**: Automatic periodic IP address changes

### Technical Differences from Traditional Proxies

**Residential Proxy Comparison**
- **IP Source**: Residential proxies use ISP connections, mobile proxies use carrier networks
- **Detection Difficulty**: Mobile proxies are significantly harder to detect
- **Geographic Precision**: Mobile proxies enable cell-tower-level location targeting

**Datacenter Proxy Comparison**
- **Reliability**: Mobile proxies blend seamlessly with genuine user traffic
- **Speed**: Slower than datacenter proxies but within practical limits
- **Cost**: Mobile proxies cost 10-20x more than datacenter alternatives

    def test_app_api(self, api_endpoint, country_code):
        """Test API from specific country mobile environment"""
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0 (iPhone; iOS 15.0)',
            'X-Country-Code': country_code
        }
        
        try:
            response = self.session.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
            return {
                'status_code': response.status_code,
                'response_time': response.elapsed.total_seconds(),
                'country': country_code
            }

## Setup and Implementation

### Basic Configuration Steps

#### 1. Proxy Configuration Setup

```python
# Mobile proxy configuration example
mobile_proxy_config = {
    'http': 'http://username:password@mobile-proxy.example.com:8080',
    'https': 'https://username:password@mobile-proxy.example.com:8080'
}

# Session setup
session = requests.Session()
session.proxies = mobile_proxy_config
```

#### 2. Mobile User Agent Configuration

```python
mobile_user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; SM-G991B) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.120 Mobile Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1'
]
```

#### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic

```python
import random
import time

def mobile_request_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            headers = {
                'User-Agent': random.choice(mobile_user_agents),
                'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
                'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.7,ja;q=0.3',
                'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
                'Connection': 'keep-alive'
            }
            
            response = session.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30)
            response.raise_for_status()
            
            return response
            
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))
                continue
            else:
                raise e
```
