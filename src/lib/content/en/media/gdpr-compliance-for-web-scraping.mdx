{/* TL;DR */}
GDPR-compliant web scraping requires **explicit consent for personal data, legitimate interest justification, and transparency measures**. Violations can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.

## GDPR and Web Scraping Relationship

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective since May 2018, is comprehensive EU legislation governing personal data protection. When web scraping involves personal data processing, GDPR compliance is mandatory.

For basic legal considerations in scraping, see our [legal issues in web scraping guide](/legal-issues-in-web-scraping-qa).

## Personal Data Under GDPR

### 1. Personal Data Definition

**Direct Personal Data**
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- Addresses, birth dates, job information
- Photos, voice recordings

**Indirect Personal Data**
- Usernames, social media handles
- IP addresses, cookie information
- Location data, search histories

**Special Categories of Personal Data**
- Race, religion, political opinions
- Health information, biometric data
- Sexual orientation, criminal records

### 2. Public Data Handling

**Public Data Still Protected**
- Public social media posts
- Employee information on company websites
- Publicly available contact details

**Key Considerations**
- Public availability doesn't exempt from GDPR
- Explicit consent still required
- Transparency and accountability mandatory

## GDPR Compliance Legal Basis

### 1. Six Legal Bases

**1. Consent**
- Clear and specific consent
- Withdrawable consent
- Most common but most restrictive

**2. Contract**
- Necessary for contract performance
- Pre-contractual measures

**3. Legal Obligation**
- Compliance with legal duties
- Tax reporting, labor law compliance

**4. Legitimate Interest**
- Controller's legitimate interests
- Not overridden by data subject rights
- Most balanced approach

**5. Vital Interest**
- Protection of life
- Emergency situations

**6. Public Interest**
- Public interest or official authority
- Government agencies primarily

### 2. Recommended Basis for Web Scraping

**Legitimate Interest Most Viable**
- EDPB May 2024 report guidance
- Requires appropriate safeguards
- Suitable for market research, price comparison, academic research

## Practical GDPR Compliance Strategies

### 1. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

**When DPIA Required**
- New technology usage
- Large-scale personal data processing
- High-risk processing activities

**DPIA Implementation Steps**
1. Assess necessity and proportionality
2. Identify individual rights and risks
3. Consider risk mitigation measures
4. Ongoing monitoring and review

### 2. Technical and Organizational Measures

**Technical Measures**
```python
# Data minimization implementation example
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_with_gdpr_compliance(url):
    # Collect only necessary minimum data
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Research Bot (GDPR Compliant)',
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract only non-personal business information
    business_info = {
        'company_name': soup.find('h1').text if soup.find('h1') else None,
        'industry': soup.find('meta', {'name': 'industry'})['content'] if soup.find('meta', {'name': 'industry'}) else None,
        # Exclude personal names, emails, phone numbers
    }
    
    return business_info
```

**Organizational Measures**
- Maintain processing records
- Regular staff training
- Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointment
- Incident response procedures

### 3. Transparency and Accountability

**Processing Record Example**
```json
{
  "processing_activity": "Market Research Scraping",
  "legal_basis": "Legitimate Interest",
  "data_categories": ["Business contact information", "Public company data"],
  "retention_period": "12 months",
  "security_measures": ["Encryption", "Access controls", "Regular audits"],
  "third_party_sharing": "None",
  "data_subject_rights": "Right to object, Right to erasure"
}
```

## Data Subject Rights Response

### 1. Key Rights

**Right of Access**
- Disclosure of processed data
- Purpose and legal basis explanation
- Retention period notification

**Right to Rectification**
- Correction of inaccurate data
- Completion of incomplete data

**Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**
- Deletion when processing unnecessary
- Consent withdrawal
- Objection to processing

**Right to Restrict Processing**
- Temporary processing suspension
- When accuracy is disputed

**Right to Data Portability**
- Structured format data provision
- Direct transfer to other controllers

### 2. Implementation Example

```python
class GDPRDataHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_store = {}
        self.processing_log = []
    
    def handle_access_request(self, data_subject_id):
        """Handle right of access"""
        if data_subject_id in self.data_store:
            return {
                'personal_data': self.data_store[data_subject_id],
                'processing_purpose': 'Market research',
                'legal_basis': 'Legitimate interest',
                'retention_period': '12 months'
            }
        return None
    
    def handle_erasure_request(self, data_subject_id):
        """Handle right to erasure"""
        if data_subject_id in self.data_store:
            del self.data_store[data_subject_id]
            self.processing_log.append({
                'action': 'erasure',
                'subject_id': data_subject_id,
                'timestamp': datetime.now()
            })
            return True
        return False
    
    def handle_objection(self, data_subject_id):
        """Handle right to object"""
        # Reassess legitimate interest
        if self.assess_legitimate_interest(data_subject_id):
            return False  # Continue processing
        else:
            return self.handle_erasure_request(data_subject_id)
```

## Penalties and Enforcement

### 1. GDPR Violation Penalties

**Administrative Fines**
- Up to €20 million
- Or 4% of annual global turnover
- Whichever is higher

**Other Sanctions**
- Warnings
- Reprimands
