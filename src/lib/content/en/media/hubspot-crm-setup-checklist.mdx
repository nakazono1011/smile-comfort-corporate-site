{/* TL;DR */}
HubSpot CRM can be fully configured in 5 days: Day 1 for email integration, Days 2-3 for data structure setup, Day 4 for workflow automation, and Day 5 for reporting. This accelerated approach gets your sales team productive immediately.

## Why Proper HubSpot Setup Matters

## Data Migration Best Practices

### Pre-Migration Data Preparation

**Data Cleansing Protocol:**

Phase 4: Custom fields and specialized data
```

### Import Configuration

**File Format Requirements:**
- CSV format preferred
- UTF-8 encoding for international characters
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Record limit: 100,000 per import

**Field Mapping Best Practices:**
```javascript
// Example Mapping Configuration

  "First Name": "firstname",
  "Last Name": "lastname", 
  "Company": "company",
  "Email": "email",
  "Phone": "phone",
  "Deal Amount": "amount",
  "Close Date": "closedate"
};
```

- Field mapping mismatches → Verify property names

**Ongoing Data Maintenance:**
```javascript
// Automated Data Quality Rules
const qualityRules = [
  {
    rule: "duplicate_contact_prevention",
    trigger: "email_match",
    action: "merge_suggestion"
  },
  {
    rule: "incomplete_company_data",
    trigger: "missing_industry",
    action: "data_enrichment_task"
  }
];
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom Objects Setup

For complex business models, configure custom objects:

```javascript
// Example: Training Program Object
const customObject = {
  name: "training_program",
  properties: [
    "program_name",
    "start_date", 
    "participant_count",
    "certification_level",
    "instructor_assigned"
  ],
  associations: ["contacts", "companies", "deals"]
};
```
