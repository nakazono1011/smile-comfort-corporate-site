## Hidden Costs and Important Considerations

### Bandwidth Calculation Method

Bright Data billing includes the sum of:

Billable Usage = Request Headers + POST Data + Response Headers + Response Data
```

This comprehensive calculation tends to result in higher usage than simpler proxy providers.

### Mid-Month Joining Calculations

Example: Joining a $500 plan on June 25th

- June usage: 6 days only = 20% of month
- Minimum commitment: $500 Ã— 20% = $100
- July 1st charge: Additional $100 to maintain commitment

### KYC (Know Your Customer) Process

Residential and mobile proxy usage requires:

- Video call verification
- Company information submission
- Identity document verification

## Payment Methods and Billing System

### Supported Payment Options

- PayPal
- Credit cards
- Payoneer
- Alipay
- Google Pay
- Wire transfers
- AWS Marketplace
- Azure billing

### Automatic Billing System

Auto-recharge triggers when balance drops below 85%. Setting up automatic recharge is highly recommended to prevent account suspension.
