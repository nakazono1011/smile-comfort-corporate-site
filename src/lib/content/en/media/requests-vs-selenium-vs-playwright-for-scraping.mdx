### Learning Curve and Development Efficiency

**Requests**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Simple scraping example
def scrape_with_requests(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='title')
    return [title.text.strip() for title in titles]
```

**Selenium**
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

def scrape_with_selenium(url):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get(url)
    
    # Wait for elements to load
    titles = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "title"))
    )
    
    results = [title.text for title in titles]
    driver.quit()
    return results
```

**Playwright**
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_with_playwright(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(url)
        
        # Auto-wait functionality
        titles = page.locator('.title').all_text_contents()
        
        browser.close()
        return titles
```

### Use Case Recommendations

#### 1. Large-Scale Static Site Processing

**Recommended: Requests**
- Reason: Superior processing speed
- Use cases: News sites, product information
- Limitation: No JavaScript rendering

#### 2. Single Page Applications (SPAs)

**Recommended: Playwright**
- Reason: Modern JavaScript support
- Use cases: React, Vue.js sites
- Benefits: Auto-wait and error handling

#### 3. Legacy Systems

**Recommended: Selenium**
- Reason: Extensive track record and stability
- Use cases: Older web applications
- Benefit: Abundant troubleshooting resources

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### Project Requirements-Based Selection

**Volume-Focused Projects**
```python
# Requests for large-scale data processing
import requests
import concurrent.futures
from itertools import islice

def batch_scrape_requests(urls, batch_size=100):
    """Efficient processing of large URL sets"""
    results = []
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor:
        for batch in batch_iterator(urls, batch_size):
            futures = [executor.submit(requests.get, url) for url in batch]
            batch_results = [f.result() for f in futures]
            results.extend(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

**Quality-Focused Projects**
```python
# Playwright for high-quality data extraction
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def quality_scrape_playwright(url):
    """High-quality data extraction"""
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        context = browser.new_context(
            viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},
            user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
        )
        page = context.new_page()
        
        # Network control
        page.route("**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg}", lambda route: route.abort())
        
        page.goto(url)
        page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
        
        data = page.evaluate('''() => {
            return {
                title: document.title,
                content: document.body.innerText,
                links: Array.from(document.links).map(link => link.href)
            };
        }''')
        
        browser.close()
        return data
```

### Proxy Integration Implementation

**Requests + Bright Data**
```python
import requests
from itertools import cycle

def requests_with_proxy_rotation(urls, proxy_list):
    """Requests with proxy rotation"""
    proxy_cycle = cycle(proxy_list)
    results = []
    
    for url in urls:
        proxy = next(proxy_cycle)
        proxy_config = {
            'http': f'http://{proxy}',
            'https': f'https://{proxy}'
        }
        
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxy_config, timeout=10)
            results.append(response.text)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error with proxy {proxy}: {e}")
    
    return results
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Error Handling

```python
import time
import random

def robust_scraping(url, tool_type='requests', max_retries=3):
    """Robust scraping implementation"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            if tool_type == 'requests':
                response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.text
            
            elif tool_type == 'playwright':
                with sync_playwright() as p:
                    browser = p.chromium.launch()
                    page = browser.new_page()
                    page.goto(url)
                    content = page.content()
                    browser.close()
                    return content
            
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                sleep_time = random.uniform(1, 3) * (attempt + 1)
                time.sleep(sleep_time)
                continue
            else:
                raise e
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
import psutil
import time

def monitor_scraping_performance(scraping_function, *args):
    """Monitor scraping performance"""
    start_time = time.time()
    start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    
    result = scraping_function(*args)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    
    metrics = {
        'execution_time': end_time - start_time,
        'memory_usage': end_memory - start_memory,
        'pages_processed': len(result) if isinstance(result, list) else 1
    }
    
    return result, metrics
```

## Conclusion

For 2025 web scraping projects, proper tool selection should consider these factors:

**Selection Criteria**
1. **Data Volume**: Large-scale processing → Requests
2. **Site Complexity**: JavaScript-heavy → Playwright
3. **Learning Curve**: Beginners → Requests
4. **Future-proofing**: New projects → Playwright

Continuous technological advancement changes tool characteristics. Combined with [proxy quality monitoring methods](/en/media/how-to-monitor-proxy-quality--performance), you can build more stable scraping systems.

Choose the optimal tool based on your project requirements and build efficient data collection systems.
