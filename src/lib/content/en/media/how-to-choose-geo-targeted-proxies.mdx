{/* TL;DR */}
When choosing geo-targeted proxies, focus on **geographic precision, proxy quality, and pricing structure**. Select between residential, datacenter, ISP, and mobile proxies based on your specific use case requirements.

## What are Geo-Targeted Proxies?

Geo-targeted proxies are proxy services that allow you to access the internet from specific geographic locations. Unlike regular proxies, these services enable you to target specific countries, cities, or even carriers and ZIP codes for highly localized access.

For fundamental proxy concepts, check out our [complete proxy services guide](/proxy-guide).

## How to Choose Geo-Targeted Proxies: 5 Key Considerations

### 1. Geographic Precision Level

**Country-Level Targeting**
- Most basic geographic targeting
- Suitable for general geo-restriction bypass
- Relatively affordable pricing

**City-Level Targeting**
- More detailed geographic targeting
- Effective for city-specific price monitoring and local SEO
- Higher pricing than country-level

**Carrier & ASN-Level Targeting**
- Most precise geographic targeting
- Essential for mobile app testing and high-precision research
- Premium pricing tier

### 2. Proxy Type Selection

**Residential Proxies**
- Use IP addresses from real residential users
- Harder to detect, higher success rates
- Pricing: Starting from $15/month (pay-as-you-go)

**Datacenter Proxies**
- IP addresses provided by data centers
- High speed but higher detection risk
- Pricing: Starting from $0.9/month (per IP)

**ISP Proxies**
- Combine residential IP stability with datacenter speed
- Ideal for long-term usage
- Pricing: Starting from $1.3/month (per IP)

**Mobile Proxies**
- Access through 3G/4G/5G networks
- Perfect for mobile-specific content access
- Pricing: Starting from $5.88/month (pay-as-you-go)

### 3. Pricing Structure Comparison

Geo-targeted proxy pricing depends on several factors:

| Factor | Impact Level | Pricing Effect |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Regional Popularity | High | US/Europe premium, others affordable |
| Geographic Precision | Medium | City-level costs 1.5-2x country-level |
| Proxy Type | High | Residential > Mobile > ISP > Datacenter |

### 4. Use Case-Specific Recommendations

**Price Monitoring & Competitive Analysis**
- Residential proxies (country-level)
- Reason: Hard to detect, suitable for long-term monitoring

**SEO Rank Checking**
- ISP proxies (city-level)
- Reason: High stability with accurate search results

**Social Media Management**
- Mobile proxies (carrier-level)
- Reason: Replicates actual mobile user behavior

**Development & Testing**
- Datacenter proxies (country-level)
- Reason: High speed, handles large request volumes
