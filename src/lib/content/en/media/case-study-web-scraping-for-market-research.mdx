### Specific Implementation Method

#### Python Scraping Code Example

```python
import time
import pandas as pd
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

class MarketResearchScraper:
    def __init__(self, proxy_config):
        self.proxy_config = proxy_config
        self.setup_driver()
    
    def setup_driver(self):
        chrome_options = Options()
        chrome_options.add_argument(f'--proxy-server={self.proxy_config}')
        chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    
    def scrape_competitor_prices(self, target_urls):
        results = []
        
        for url in target_urls:
            try:
                self.driver.get(url)
                time.sleep(2)
                
                # Get price element
                price_element = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'price')
                price = price_element.text
                
                # Get product name
                title_element = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'product-title')
                title = title_element.text
                
                results.append({
                    'url': url,
                    'title': title,
                    'price': price,
                    'timestamp': pd.Timestamp.now()
                })
                
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error: {url} - {e}")
                
        return results
```

- **Regular Maintenance**: Script updates and testing

## Data Analysis and Utilization Methods

### Analysis Methods for Collected Data

#### 1. Price Trend Analysis
```python
# Price trend visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

def analyze_price_trends(data):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
    df['price_numeric'] = pd.to_numeric(df['price'].str.replace(',', '').str.replace('$', ''))
    
    # Price trends by product
    for product in df['title'].unique():
        product_data = df[df['title'] == product]
        plt.plot(product_data['timestamp'], product_data['price_numeric'], label=product)
    
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    plt.title('Competitor Product Price Trends')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

#### 2. Competitive Analysis Report
- **Price Distribution Analysis**: Understanding market price ranges
- **Price Change Patterns**: Sale and campaign trends
- **Inventory Status Tracking**: Demand forecasting utilization

### Business Application Examples

#### Dynamic Pricing
Automatic price adjustment system utilizing collected data:

```python
def dynamic_pricing_strategy(competitor_prices, our_cost, target_margin):
    min_competitor_price = min(competitor_prices)
    max_competitor_price = max(competitor_prices)
    
    # Set 5% below competitor minimum (with profit assurance condition)
    target_price = min_competitor_price * 0.95
    min_price = our_cost * (1 + target_margin)
    
    optimal_price = max(target_price, min_price)
    
    return optimal_price
```
