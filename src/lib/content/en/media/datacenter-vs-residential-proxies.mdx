{/* TL;DR */}
Datacenter proxies offer speed and affordability, while residential proxies provide superior anonymity and lower detection rates. Choose based on your specific use case.

## Understanding the Core Differences

When selecting proxy servers, understanding the fundamental differences between datacenter and residential proxies is crucial for making an informed decision. Before diving into specifics, it's helpful to understand the [basic proxy concepts](/proxy-guide) and how they apply to your particular use case.

### What Are Datacenter Proxies?

Datacenter proxies are IP addresses hosted on servers owned by cloud hosting companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Digital Ocean. These proxies are created in bulk within data centers and are not associated with Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

**Key Characteristics:**
- High-speed connections with minimal latency
- Cost-effective pricing for bulk usage
- Multiple IP addresses from the same subnet
- Easier to detect by anti-bot systems

### What Are Residential Proxies?

Residential proxies use IP addresses assigned by Internet Service Providers to real residential households. These IPs are sourced from actual devices like smartphones, computers, and home routers connected to residential internet networks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- High anonymity and legitimacy
- Lower detection rates by websites
- Variable connection speeds
- Higher pricing due to sourcing complexity

## Speed and Performance Analysis

### Datacenter Proxy Performance

Datacenter proxies excel in speed and reliability metrics:

- **Response Time**: Under 0.3 seconds average
- **Bandwidth**: Unlimited in most cases
- **Concurrent Connections**: Thousands supported
- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ guaranteed
- **Stability**: Consistent performance 24/7

### Residential Proxy Performance

Residential proxies have variable performance due to their nature:

- **Response Time**: 1-3 seconds average
- **Bandwidth**: Dependent on home network capacity
- **Concurrent Connections**: Limited by residential ISP
- **Uptime**: Subject to home network stability
- **Stability**: Varies by geographic location

## Pricing Comparison: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Datacenter Proxy Pricing (2024)

Datacenter proxies offer exceptional value for money:

| Provider | Dedicated IP | Shared IP | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Bright Data | $2.13/IP | $0.85/IP | $20+ |
| Oxylabs | $1.20/IP | $0.90/IP | $24+ |
| Smartproxy | $1.33/IP | $0.50/IP | $15+ |

### Residential Proxy Pricing (2024)

Residential proxies command premium pricing:

| Provider | Pricing Model | Per GB | Monthly Cost |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| Bright Data | Pay-as-you-go | $15+ | $500+ |
| Oxylabs | Traffic-based | $12+ | $400+ |
| Smartproxy | Bandwidth-based | $8.5+ | $250+ |

The higher cost of residential proxies reflects the complexity of sourcing and maintaining real residential IP addresses. For detailed pricing information, refer to our [Bright Data pricing breakdown](/en/media/bright-data-pricing-explained).

## Anonymity and Detection Rates

### Datacenter Proxy Detection

Datacenter proxies face higher detection rates due to:

- **IP Origin**: Easily identified as datacenter-sourced
- **Traffic Patterns**: Non-human-like request patterns
- **Blacklisting**: Known datacenter IP ranges
- **Detection Rate**: 30-50% average

### Residential Proxy Detection

Residential proxies maintain superior anonymity through:

- **IP Origin**: Legitimate ISP-assigned addresses
- **Traffic Patterns**: Natural user behavior simulation
- **Whitelisting**: Trusted by most websites
- **Detection Rate**: 5-10% average
